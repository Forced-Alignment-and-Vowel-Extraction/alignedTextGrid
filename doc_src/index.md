# alignedTextGrid

The goal of this package is to make the hierarchical and precedence relationships in 
TextGrids produced by forced alignment accessable and leverageable for analysis
or recoding.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Forced-Alignment-and-Vowel-Extraction/alignedTextGrid/tree/main
```
