The aligned-textgrid package provides a python interface for representing and operating on TextGrids produced by forced aligners like [FAVE](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE) or the [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Classes provided by aligned-textgrid represent hierarchical and precedence relationships among data stored in TextGrid formats allowing for simplified and more accessible analysis of aligned speech data. 

## Example Use Cases

- You want to quickly loop through the Phone tier of a Textgrid, and *also* access information about the word it is a part of.
- You want to quickly loop over the Word tier of a Textgrid and quickly count how many phones it has.
- You want to programmatically merge together adjacent Textgrid intervals.

For examples on how to use the pacakge, see the [Usage](usage/) pages.

## Installation
<!-- TODO: documnet other package managers like conda -CB 14 March 2023 -->
To install aligned-textgrid using pip, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install aligned-textgrid
```


## Not another TextGrid implementation

There are several other packages that parse Praat Textgrids, including

- [praatio](http://timmahrt.github.io/praatIO/praatio.html)
- [textgrid](https://github.com/kylebgorman/textgrid)

`aligned-textgrid`'s goal is to capture hierarchical and sequential relationships represented in many TextGrids, and to make them easilly accessible to users via an intuitive interface. The goal is that from any arbitrary location within a TextGrid, users can easilly access information with minimally defensive coding.

### Example

As an example, we'll read in a textgrid produced with forced alignment that contains a single speaker with a word and phone tier.

```{python}
from aligned_textgrid import AlignedTextGrid, Word, Phone
tg = AlignedTextGrid(
    textgrid_path='usage/resources/josef-fruehwald_speaker.TextGrid', 
    entry_classes=[Word, Phone]
    )
```

Then, we can access an arbitrary phone interval.

```{python}
arbitrary_interval = tg[0].Phone[20]
```

From this aribitrary interval, we can access information about the intervals preceding and following with the `.prev` and `.fol` attributes.

```{python}
print(arbitrary_interval.prev.label)
print(arbitrary_interval.label)
print(arbitrary_interval.fol.label)
```

We can also access information about the word this interval is nested within with the `.inword` attribute.

```{python}
print(arbitrary_interval.inword.label)
```

The object returned by `.inword` is just another interval, meaning we can access informaton about *it's* context with the `.prev` and `.fol` attributes as well.

```{python}
print(arbitrary_interval.inword.prev.label)
print(arbitrary_interval.inword.label)
print(arbitrary_interval.inword.fol.label)
```
